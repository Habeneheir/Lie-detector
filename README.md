A comparision between GSR - Galvanic Skin Response (GSR value is the average calculated from 10 measurements)	and HR - Human resistance (Skin Resistance)	has been made and the result is displayed under Poligraf.pdf


In the context of a lie detector or polygraph, an increase in skin conductance may be interpreted as a physiological response to stress or deception. However, it's essential to note that while changes in skin conductance can be associated with arousal, they are not specific to deception and can be influenced by various factors, such as anxiety, fear, or excitement.

Measuring skin resistance is typically done by applying a small electrical voltage across the skin and measuring the resulting electrical current. The fluctuations in this current correspond to changes in skin conductance, providing insights into the individual's physiological state.
